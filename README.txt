Everything was originally writted in iPython notebooks. The .ipynb files
	can be found in the three branches listed below.
The .py files in the master branch may not run immediately, and may need
	some lines relating to iPython removing from the start of the file

Exponential Branch = Exponential Error Growth scheme comparison - Finished

SimpleOsc Branch = Simple oscillator code - Finished

ShallowWater Branch = 2D Dimensionless Shallow Water solver code - Finished

Current status:

- Completed
- Possible error in boundary conditions of shallow water solver causing the
	geostrophically balanced jet to break down after t~34 in the
	validation test
